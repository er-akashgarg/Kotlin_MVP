# KotlinMVP_Basic
Basic Structure what we plan before starting a project. Its not very complex I have kept it much simpler for better understanding using Kotlin MVP
# Build environment requirements
In order to build Kotlin distribution you need to have:
>JDK 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 and 9

# Setup environment variables as following:
 > JAVA_HOME="path to JDK 1.8"
 
 > JDK_16="path to JDK 1.6"
 
 > JDK_17="path to JDK 1.7"
 
 > JDK_18="path to JDK 1.8"
 
 > JDK_9="path to JDK 9"
 
For local development, if you're not working on bytecode generation or the standard library, it's OK to have only JDK 1.8 and JDK 9 installed, and to point JDK_16 and JDK_17 environment variables to your JDK 1.8 installation.
